A Python project demonstrating the use of functions and modules by calculating factorials and performing mathematical computations using the math module.

## Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

Write a Python program that:

1. Defines a function named factorial that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a loop or recursion.
2. Returns the calculated factorial.
3. Calls the function with a sample number and prints the output.

## Expected Output

For example, if the function is called with 5, it should return:
```
Factorial of 5 is: 120
```
## Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

Write a Python program that:

1. Asks the user for a number as input.
2. Uses the math module to calculate the:
 * Square root of the number
 * Natural logarithm (log base e) of the number
 * Sine of the number (in radians)

3. Displays the calculated results.

## Expected Output

For example, if the user enters 25, the output should be:
```
Square root of 25 is: 5.0
Natural log of 25 is: 3.2189
Sine of 25 radians is: -0.1324
```
